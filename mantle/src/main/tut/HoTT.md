## Provingground - Basic Homotopy Type theory implementation

These notes concern the object _HoTT_, which has the core implementation of homotopy type theory.

The major components of homotopy type theory implemented in the object HoTT are

* Terms, types and Universes.
* Function and dependent function types.
* λs.
* Pairs and Dependent pairs.
* Disjoint union types.
* Types 0 and 1 and an object in the latter.
* Identity types

Inductive types, induction and recursion are in different objects as they are rather subtle. The other major way (also not in the _HoTT_ object) of constructing non-composite types is to wrap scala types, possibly including symbolic algebra.


The _core_ project contains code that is agnostic to how it is run. In particular this also compiles to scala-js.




### Universes, Symbolic types

We have a family of universes, but mostly use the first one denoted by Type. Given a type, we can construct symbolic objects of that type. We construct such a type _A_.


```tut
import provingground._, HoTT._
val A = "A" :: Type
A == Type.::("A")
```

We consider a symbolic object of the type _A_


```tut
val a = "a" :: A
```


## Function types, lambdas, Identity

Given types A and B, we have the function type A → B. An element of this is a function from A to B.

We can construct functions using λ's. Here, for the type _A_, we construct the identity on _A_ using a lambda. We can then view this as a dependent function of _A_, giving the identity function.

In this definition, two λ's are used, with the method _lmbda_ telling the TypecompilerType that the result is a (non-dependent) function.


```tut
val id = lambda(A)(lmbda(a)(a))
```


The type of the identity function is a mixture of Pi-types and function types. Which of these to use is determined by checking dependence of the type of the value on the varaible in a λ-definition.


```tut
id.typ
lmbda(a)(a).typ
lmbda(a)(a).typ.dependsOn(A)
```


The lambdas have the same effect at runtime. It is checked if the type of the value depends on the variable.
The result is either _LambdaFixed_ or _Lambda_ accordingly.


```tut
val indep = lmbda(a)(a)
val dep = lambda(a)(a)
indep == dep
```

Note that we have alternative notation for lambdas, the maps to methods `:->` and `:~>`.
For instance, we can define the identity using these.

```tut
assert(id == A :~> (a :-> a))
```

### Hygiene for λs

A new variable object, which has the same toString, is created in making lambdas. This is to avoid name clashes.


```tut
val l = dep.asInstanceOf[LambdaFixed[Term, Term]]
l.variable
l.variable == a
```

## Modus Ponens

We construct Modus Ponens, as an object in Homotopy Type theory. Note that A ->: B is the function type A → B.


```tut
val B = "B" :: Type

val f = "f" :: (A ->: B)

val mp = lambda(A)(lambda(B)(lmbda(a)(lmbda(f)(f(a)))))
```

The type of Modus Ponens is again a mixture of Pi-types and function types.


```tut
mp.typ
```


We can apply modus ponens with the roles of _A_ and _B_ reversed. This still works because variable clashes are avoided.


```tut
val mpBA = mp(B)(A)
mpBA.typ == B ->: (B ->: A) ->: A
```


### Equality of λs

Lambdas do not depend on the name of the variable.


```tut
val aa = "aa" :: A
lmbda(aa)(aa) == lmbda(a)(a)
(lmbda(aa)(aa))(a) == a
```


## Dependent types

Given a type family, we can construct the corresponding Pi-types and Sigma-types. We start with a formal type family, which is just a symbolic object of the appropriate type.


```tut
val Bs = "B(_ : A)" :: (A ->: Type)
```


### Pi-Types

In addition to the case class constructor, there is an agda/shapeless-like  convenience method for constructing Pi-types. Namely, given a type expression that depends on a varaible _a : A_, we can construct the Pi-type correspoding to the obtained λ-expression.

Note that the !: method just claims and checks a type, and is useful (e.g. here) for documentation.


```tut
val fmly = (a !: A) ~>: (Bs(a) ->: A)
```


### Sigma-types

There is also a convenience method for defining Sigma types using λs.


```tut
Sgma(a !: A, Bs(a))
```



```tut
Sgma(a !: A, Bs(a) ->: Bs(a) ->: A)
```


## Pair types

Like functions and dependent functions, pairs and dependent pairs can be handled together. The _mkPair_ function assignes the right type after checking dependence, choosing between pair types, pairs and dependent pairs.


```tut
val ba = "b(a)" :: Bs(a)
val b = "b" :: B
mkPair(A, B)
mkPair(a, b)
mkPair(a, b).typ
mkPair(a, ba).typ
```


```tut
mkPair(A, B).asInstanceOf[ProdTyp[Term, Term]]
```


## Plus types

We can also construct the plus type _A plus B_, which comes with two inclusion functions.


```tut
val AplusB = PlusTyp(A, B)
```


```tut
AplusB.incl1(a)
```


```tut
AplusB.incl2
```

In the above, a λ was used, with a variable automatically generated. These have names starting with $ to avoid collision with user defined ones.

## Identity type

We have an identity type associated to a type _A_, with reflexivity giving terms of this type.


```tut
val eqAa = IdentityTyp(A, a, a)
val ref = Refl(A, a)
```


```tut
ref.typ == eqAa
```


## The Unit and the  Nought

Finally, we have the types corresponding to _True_ and _False_


```tut
Unit
Zero
Star !: Unit
```
